# TL;DR: do NOT delete this empty file
# This file is blank to make Fastlane define the SharedValue::ENVIRONMENT variable,
# which is part of our fastlane/Fastfile configurations.

# In Fastlane's cli_tools, Fastlane removes the --env index from ARGV pretty early so we can't know
# what the user passed to the --env parameter.

# Unfortunatly, Fastlane search the .env files only in the fastlane folder and
# in it's parent folder (the ios folder, in our case). It means that, in our project,
# Fastlane won't find any .env files.

# When Fastlane fails to find .env files, it does not call the function load_dot_envs_from,
# which is responsible to define the SharedValue::ENVIRONMENT variable, which we use inside our Fastfile (Source)

# This file is a hack that will make Fastlane find an empty .env file.
# It will then set the SharedValue::ENVIRONMENT to the ARGV value.
# We then use SharedValue::ENVIRONMENT inside Fastlane to load the right file from the right place.
